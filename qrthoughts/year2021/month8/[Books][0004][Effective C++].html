            <p>
                Acturally I collected the first 3 versions of this book. What I read is about the 2nd version on my cellphone. Acturally I have finished reading it for a couple of months, and almost forget the whole fifty-five ways introduced in the book. I just learned that it seemed is HOUJie who first translated it.

                I just list some rules that I am not quite familiar with, or those that I think I need to pay attention to. And I decide to keep the 3rd version, so the number below is in 3rd version.<br />

                1) 07: Declare destructors virtual in polymorphic base classes. Remind myself to notice that when I write new class.<br />
                
                2) 49: Understand the behavior of the new-handler. I need to think what if the operator new fails if I allocate a huge memory.<br />

                3) Try to make the interface completed and small.<br />

                4) Avoid overload on pointer and value type, like string* and int.<br />

                5) 26: Postpone variable definitions as long as possible.<br />

                6) 31: Minimize compilation dependencies between files.<br />

                7) 34: Inheritance of interface and inheritance of implimentation.<br />

                The last several probles are interesting. We also learn that some websites offer public apis.<br />
