            <p>
                There are tons of books in this universe, I think it's good to read some of them. I think it's a good idea to update the study notes daily.

                The expansition of the universe, may leads back that there is a back beginning of the universe.<br />
                If we suppose that the whole universe is in the precious of Dimensionality reduction... <br />
                The galaxy is formed because of the origional vaibraiton of the universe.<br />
                Such a wild and crazy mind that we can observe the movement of a whole galaxy.<br />
                A fixed star is with graviaty collapse and nuclear fusion. At the end of a fixed star, it collapsed and then explosed because of the neutrino, and spread the matter around.<br />
                The theory of plate tectonics.<br />
                Self-organizing Theory<br />
                cytochrome, confers enengy via Fe^2+ Fe^2+<br />

                At the end of this book, there is a history line. About 2.35*10^8years ago, the dianasors and the flowers appeared. The other thing is that the internet was invented just 30 years ago. How fast our technology developed. 
                Also I think it's good to study more about the history, geography, biology, geometry. The dimensional marks our ourselves as humanbing in this universe.[202108070004]
