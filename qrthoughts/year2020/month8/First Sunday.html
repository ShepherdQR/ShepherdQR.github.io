<h2>First Sunday</h2>
<p>
    Actually it is time to plan living alone for a quite long time. While selfhood is still in the process of being built. The last 6 days, felt tired as always after work. Actually, it is the routines, or the socalled daily life that shapes and transforms a person from himself to the other one.
</p>

<p>
    The very first thing that I learned these days, is that we cannot process anything. No matter how strong you desire is, what eventually left around one hundred year later in the future, is the infect you pushed on other things. And most of the time, most of the people are not or even not thinking to push the humanbeing forward. I donot think a project or a programme can help obtaining something new, as long as the schame is limited.
</p>

<p>
    I, of course, still want to leave something really matters.
</p>

<p>
    Recently, I need to reduce the amount of my luggage. Too many thing is not good. What a pity that I did not let the school teachers deliever the baggage home! Also not bad, cause we donot process anything, eventually.
</p>

<p>
    I ate two bananas just now. The last banana was lying on the table, and I, with little desire, ate it.
