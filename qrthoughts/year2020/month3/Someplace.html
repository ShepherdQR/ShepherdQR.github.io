    Sunshine always cheers. The warm wind last night, is that charming and kinda unreal. Time flies, while beautiful wind is still. Cannot tell if it's the air or the people flowing and swinging slightly.
</p>

<p>
    While binded with the sunshine, some old goldern memories flow top of mind lake. I now remember a place, maybe junior high, while not quite sure. There I helped around while others carried some baggage. I at that time was quite sure that I didn't need to live in that kinda flats. The sunshine was the same charming as the one drowning me right now.

    Someplace locally will disappear. As the solar moves randomly, also slowly compared with humanbing livingtime, places can and only can live locally. Can the communications spread out? Well, I donot want to be that pessimistic, because the spreading revoling nothing. Meaning hides somewhere elsewhere.

    Oh, sunshine, wish burried in the charming windy sunshine. What wonderful sunshine!
