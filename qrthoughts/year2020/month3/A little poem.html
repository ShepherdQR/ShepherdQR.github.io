<h2>A little poem</h2>
<p>
    When checking my email for some old stuff, I found this little poem. I wrote it before 2017101400:32, so maybe in the midnight. It's not good, but I love part of it. "Toast to the shadow with no mercy, and to the past for no future to pray." I guess perhaps it's the time when I love it, something had changed. And here is the origional version of the whole poem.
</p>
<p>
    By the way, I wonder if it possible to write something, considering that I had read every modern poem book in Chinese in both libraries of the university.
</p>

<p>
    For those who will always be there, thou shalt forever be. Toast to the shadow with no mercy, and to the past for no future to pray.   -----To my beloved
</p>
<p>
    Rose, slightly as sloth sough, asleep the clough depth.<br />
    The mental pattern initially slides into the hole.<br />
    Rises the cafeteria and the hat that he used to ware.<br />
    Himself, tough also gentle, queenâ€™s always.<br />
    <br />
    Clun be rolled, color and themselves, golden.<br />
    Together the highly breathing air.<br />
    Yet, filled enough a glance, just with a toast.
